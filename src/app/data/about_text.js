    text: `Welcome!

My name is Yaniv Romem.I'm 33 years old, living in Tel Aviv.

For the better part of my life, I’ve been pursuing my childhood dream of becoming a musician, but through the years I’ve realized that while music will always remain my love, it should not be my profession as well.

A year and a half ago, I decided to change direction and instead aim at another subject I was always fascinated by- Software Development.

    As a kid I loved building Websites using Photoshop and HTML.Back then I barely knew English, but it didn't stop me from building the things I wanted, using the tools and knowledge I managed to find on my own. Today, having learned Software Development properly, I believe my experience, determination, and continuous will to learn will help me get along in any work environment I'll set foot in.`
